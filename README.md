# **Background Information**
The project aims to simulate a production environment where three sensors send data to an anomaly detection algorithm. This algorithm evaluates the input of the sensors and forwards the results to a dashboard, which can be used to monitor the production line. In order to simulate the sensors a data stream is used, generating synthetical data.  
This project includes the whole process from data generation to deployment of the system on a cloud environment.  

# **Environment Setup**
Before describing the implementation of the above mentioned project the prerequisites and tools used are listed below:
- **Linux (native or WSL): This project is designed to run on Linux. It is recommended to use a Linux machine or WSL if you are using Windows. Running the project on Windows or macOS can cause problems. WSL can be installed following this [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/wsl/install).
- **Python:** This project requires Python 3.7 or later.
- **Docker:** Docker is needed to containerize the system. It is also possible to run it only locally. Then Docker is not required.
- **Terraform:** Terraform is used to create the cloud infrastructure on AWS. It is only needed if the system is be deployed on the cloud.
- **AWS account:** An AWS account is required for deployment. Like Terraform, it is only necessary if the system is to be deployed on the cloud.

To install the required dependencies to run this project locally, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.tx
```
